# vaulttask

I created the project in Java, using SpringBoot, 
as we used that for most of our projects, 
even if it seems like an overkill for this task.

What I enjoyed most were the algorithms for filtering out the cases.

I gave some thought to the project structure and 
implemented an interface for the case the source of data is changed in the future.
